# H1B-Visa-Analytics-Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project showcases a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for visualizing H1B visa application data in the United States. The interactive dashboard provides insights into application counts by state and city, industry distributions, and historical trends with predictive analytics for future applications.

## Features
- Interactive Dashboard: An intuitive interface to navigate through H1B visa application statistics.
- Multifaceted Data Analysis: Industry-specific breakdown, geographic distribution, and application outcomes (approvals and denials).
- Historical Trends and Predictions: Analysis of application trends over the years with predictive modeling for future trends.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this dashboard is obtained from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), detailing various aspects of H1B visa applications.
The cleaned dataset for H1B visa applications from 2009 to 2023 can be found on Kaggle:
